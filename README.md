# tvm-news

A tool for generating the TVM newsletter's detailed statistics.

The initial version of this tool was written by
[Ziheng Jiang](https://github.com/ZihengJiang).

In order to make it more discoverable and reusable I packaged it
as a poetry package and made some updates and additions.

If you already have Poetry installed you can run the tool like
so `poetry run tvm-news <args>`.

For supported arguments check `poetry run tvm-news --help`.
